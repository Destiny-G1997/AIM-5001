    "This project aims to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions. Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses, irrespective of geography, industry, and size of the company. Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff, and training new staff.[1] I will use the IBM dataset to show the ranking of factors' lead to attrition. As we all know that the employee attrition led by various factors such as 'Distance From Home', 'EnvironmentSatisfaction', 'job satisfaction'... and so on. This project aims to dig the difference of weight between factors to factors. The reference link is a machine learning prediction on this dataset. I think this dataset source is very useful. So I decide to use this dataset to finish my final project's research. "

    "**Q1:** What's the rate of the emplyees that have 'yearsAtCompany' more than 5 years?  \n",
    "**Q2:** What's the rate of the employees that have 'education' higher than 2 and 'YearsAtCompany' over than5?  \n",
    "**Q3** What's the rate of those attrition employees whose 'MaritalStatus' are single?  \n",
    "**Q4** what's the rate of those attrition emplyees whose 'JobSatisfaction' are lower than 3?  \n",
    "**Q5** What's the difference of these 4 rates in 2016 and 2020?  \n",
    "I think these questions' answers are very valuable for HR in IBM or any other company. It can help them understand what's the possible reason that drives employee attrition happening."

    "All my data are from 'Kaggle'. I will collect data sources by downloading from the 'Kaggle' and An Web API. I choose two data with similar contents in different years from 'Kaggle'. One data is from the link that I provide in the reference. And the other data is also from \"kaggle\"[2]. There are two ways to get data from Kaggle. One is to download CSV. The other one is using Web API. I will not download this one directly. I will use **import SSL**  to get the data[2] through the Web API."

    " First, I will check the datatypes and other details in the dataset by using the pandas_profiling feature. The dataset I choose has info about samples of employees in IBM including: \"Attrition, BusinessTravel, DailyRate, Department, DistanceFromHome, Education, EducationField, EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, EnvironmentSatisfaction, Gender, HourlyRate, JobInvolvement, JobLevel, job role, job satisfaction, marital status, monthly income, monthly rate, NumCompaniesWorked, Over18, OverTime, PercentSalaryHike, PerformanceRating, RelationshipSatisfaction, StandardHours, StockOptionLevel, TotalWorkingYears, TrainingTimesLastYear, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager\". I will analyze this dataset from multi-dimension to analyze which factor matters the most on employee attrition. And the top 5 factors that possibly lead to employee attrition. To achieve this research I will use **Matplotlib & Seaborn** features. The method that I will use that is not covered in our class is **pandas_profiling**. In the last, I will parallel compare the top5 factors in 2016 and 2020 to research have the factors changed in these 4 years."
